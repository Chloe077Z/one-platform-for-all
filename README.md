# One Platform For All 🌍

> A lightweight experimental web project designed to explore accessible solutions for international student support and information sharing.

## ✨ About This Project

This is one of my first self-built websites, created as part of my personal learning journey.  
As a beginner in both **web development** and **entrepreneurship**, I wanted to experiment with simple tools (HTML/CSS only) to prototype ideas that could one day support international students like me.

The idea is based on a simple question:  
**"How might we make it easier for international students to find helpful, trusted, and localized support?"**

This page is not a final product, but a small step toward exploring what I could build — and more importantly, what I could **learn**.

## 🧠 Features (Minimal!)

- 🏡 Landing page with introductory visuals  
- 📦 Local support-related visuals (housing, peer help, etc.)  
- 💡 Clean, responsive HTML/CSS layout  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML (vanilla)  
- CSS (vanilla)  
- Built & deployed manually via GitHub  

## 💬 A Personal Note

I’m still new to both programming and startup thinking, and this project is not polished.  
But I’m proud of taking this small step, and hope to keep growing, learning, and building better things — even if just a little bit each week.

If you accidentally found this page, thank you for reading — feel free to offer feedback or advice!
